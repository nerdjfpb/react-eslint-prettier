# React app with eslint, prettier and husky

This project is for the blog. The main reason for this blog is that as a developer, we have to work with a team (most of the cases), and different people write codes in various styles and use different IDE's! Working with a team can be challenging, sometimes with minor issues. So we're going to force a specific code guide and formatting so that every code pushed into repo looks impressive!

## To run this

- Clone the repo in your machine
